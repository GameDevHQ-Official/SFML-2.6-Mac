# SFML-2.6-Mac
A Ready Mac Solution for Visual Studio Code and  SFML 2.6

SFML 2.6.0 Template Project for macOS + VS Code
===============================================

1. Install VS Code and the C++ extension (by Microsoft)
2. Open this project folder in VS Code (template_project/)
3. Press Cmd+Shift+B to build
4. Run ./main
5. If you see a security prompt from macOS about 'app', allow it in System Settings > Privacy & Security

Make sure youâ€™re using a modern version of Xcode Command Line Tools (run `xcode-select --install` if unsure)

DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is handled by the debugger for runtime linking to SFML.
